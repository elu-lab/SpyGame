# Microscopic Analysis on LLM Players via Social Deduction Game (Under review)

[[Paper (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09946)]

Our study aimed to conduct a microscopic analysis of LLMs' support of obscured communication.
Specifically, we let LLMs play a social deduction game called Spy Game, which is a variation of [Spyfall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyfall_(card_game)).
